Project Description: Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

Sales are mainly driven by Distributor and Wholesale channels, with the Central region leading significantly.
Pricing margins are healthy, but discount patterns show opportunities to improve profitability. Regional imbalance and warehouse overload reveal operational inefficiencies. 
Recommendations include optimizing discounts, expanding online and regional sales, balancing warehouse load, and improving delivery speed for better customer satisfaction and growth.
