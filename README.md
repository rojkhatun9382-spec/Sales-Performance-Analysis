Project Description: Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

The Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard is designed to provide a clear and interactive overview of company sales across different channels, regions, and months.
The dataset includes key attributes such as Order Number, Sales Channel, Warehouse Code, Order Dates, Delivery Dates, Product ID, Order Quantity, Discount, Unit Price, and Regional Data.

This project aims to help the company analyze overall sales performance, identify top-performing regions and sales channels, and support data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard visually represents the contribution of each sales channel — In-Store (44.65%), Online (28.18%), Distributor (13.26%), and Wholesale (13.91%) — along with a detailed Regional and Monthly Sales Comparison.

Through this analysis, the company can track sales trends, evaluate performance differences across regions, and improve strategies for underperforming areas. The insights help enhance marketing focus, optimize resource allocation, and increase overall profitability.# Sales-Performance-Analysis
